# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I built this project while following my prework to learn how to set up a basic webpage. I learned how to set up and format text using HTML. Using CSS I learned how to stylize my webpage by changing colors and adding cards to make the information pop out from the rest of the page. Then using JavaScript I coded scripts to put all my topics into an array and ran them into a random number generator to select a topic at random. Finally I used Git to create seperate branches so I can work on individual versions seperate from the main version and then merge them with the main.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Each card on the webpage contains some notes on each topic I learned about while completing my pre work.
